/* DESCRIPTION:
Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts. Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.

When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter), are digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.

Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:

S is misinterpreted as 5
O is misinterpreted as 0
I is misinterpreted as 1
The test cases contain numbers only by mistake. */

function correct(string) {
  let correctStr = '';
  for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
    if (string[i] === '5') {
      correctStr += 'S'
    } else if (string[i] === '0') {
      correctStr += 'O'
    } else if (string[i] === '1') {
      correctStr += 'I'
    } else {
      correctStr += string[i]
    }
